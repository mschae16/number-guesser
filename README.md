# Project Number Guesser
## A Turing school project, front-end development program
### Margo Schaedel

This project involves a user-focused number-guessing game, in which the browser displays several input fields for setting a minimum and maximum number range, a field for inputting the user's guess, and also buttons to assess whether the guess is correct, to clear the field, and to reset the entire game.  If the user guesses a number that is too low, the page will display the user's guess, as well as text indicating that the guess is too low.  If the number is too high, the page will display its corresponding text to indicate that to the user.  If the guess is correct, the user receives the message, "BOOM."  The user can reset the game at any time if s/he wishes. If the user changes the minimum or maximum values mid-game, the range will change automatically, thus effecting a reset.

In future, the game will be updated to include additional features, such as adding additional levels of difficulty for the user, by increasing the number range with each successful guess.
